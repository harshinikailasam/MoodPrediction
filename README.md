# MoodPrediction 

MoodPrediction is a machine learning project that predicts a person’s mood using classification models trained on behavioral and contextual data. The project is based on a realistic dataset and explores multiple algorithms to find the most effective model for mood classification.

##  Project Objectives
- Build accurate mood prediction models using supervised classification techniques.
- Analyze the performance of different algorithms.
- Provide a clean and reproducible workflow from data processing to model evaluation.

##  Dataset
- **File**: `realistic_moodsense_dataset.csv`
- **Description**: Contains features such as time of day, activity levels, social context, and other behavioral attributes that influence mood.
- **Target variable**: Mood label (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral)
